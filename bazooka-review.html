                    <p><em>Bazooka</em> is a 2025 Indian Malayalam-language action thriller film written and directed by Deeno Dennis in his directorial debut. Starring Mammootty and Gautham Vasudev Menon in the lead roles, with supporting performances from Shine Tom Chacko and others, the film was produced by Yoodlee Films and Theatre of Dreams. Promising to be a "game thriller" in its unique premise, the film, unfortunately, falls short in delivering a compelling story, earning mixed to negative reviews from critics and audiences alike.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Development & Production</h2>
                    <p>The project originated in 2018, when Dennis conceptualized a script revolving around mysterious incidents tied to gaming. Mammootty, approached for the role, insisted that Dennis himself should direct the film. After a prolonged development phase, <em>Bazooka</em> officially began production in 2023 and wrapped filming in October 2024. Key production highlights include cinematography by Nimish Ravi, music by Saeed Abbas, and action choreography by Stunt Silva.</p>
                    <p>The film’s post-production and marketing phases created significant anticipation, with teasers and trailers showcasing slick visuals and intense action sequences.</p>

                    <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
                    <p>The story revolves around Aryan Acharya (Mammootty), aka Bazooka, a retired forensic scientist and ethical hacker, who teams up with ACP Benjamin Joshua (Gautham Vasudev Menon) to track down a group of robbers. These criminals, inspired by video game patterns, execute a series of heists across Kochi. The narrative intertwines elements of gaming, crime investigation, and personal vendettas. However, the plot struggles to maintain coherence, often meandering into predictable tropes.</p>

                    <h2>Performances</h2>
                    <p>Mammootty’s portrayal of Aryan Acharya is undoubtedly the film’s backbone. His transformation into the enigmatic Bazooka and his commanding presence elevate the otherwise underwhelming script. Gautham Vasudev Menon’s nuanced performance as ACP Benjamin Joshua adds depth, but his character is underwritten.</p>
                    <p>Supporting actors like Shine Tom Chacko, Divya Pillai, and Sidharth Bharathan deliver adequate performances, though they are constrained by the limited scope of their roles. Cameos by Babu Antony and Shine Tom Chacko add flair but lack substantial impact on the story.</p>

                    <h2>Direction & Screenplay</h2>
                    <p>Deeno Dennis’s debut as a director showcases promise, particularly in crafting visually engaging action sequences. However, the screenplay is a letdown. The gaming element, touted as the film’s unique hook, is underutilized, failing to integrate meaningfully with the narrative. The story’s lack of focus and over-reliance on familiar tropes hinder its potential.</p>

                    <h2>Cinematography & Music</h2>
                    <p>The cinematography by Nimish Ravi is a highlight, presenting Kochi’s cityscapes and action sequences in a visually stunning manner. Saeed Abbas’s background score adds intensity to key scenes but isn’t memorable beyond the film.</p>

                    <h2>Editing & Pacing</h2>
                    <p>Editing by Nishadh Yusuf and Praveen Prabhakar is inconsistent. While some sequences are tightly executed, others drag, leading to uneven pacing. A more concise runtime could have significantly improved the film’s overall impact.</p>

                    <h2>Personal Opinion on Bazooka</h2>
                    <p>As a fan of Mammootty, I was initially excited about <em>Bazooka</em>. However, the film didn’t live up to its hype. While the performances and visuals are commendable, the average storyline and missed opportunities in exploring the gaming theme made it underwhelming.</p>
                

                    <h2>Verdict on Bazooka</h2>
                    <p>While <em>Bazooka</em> has its moments of brilliance, particularly in Mammootty’s performance and the cinematography, it ultimately falls short due to a lackluster script and inconsistent execution. It’s a decent one-time watch for fans of action thrillers but doesn’t leave a lasting impression.</p>
