                    <h2>Review</h2>
                    <p><strong>Thudarum</strong>, directed by Tharun Moorthy and starring Mohanlal and Shobana, is a gripping Malayalam crime thriller that brings both emotional depth and intense suspense to the big screen. Released on 25 April 2025, the film has garnered widespread critical acclaim, and for good reason. With a stellar performance by Mohanlal, an engaging screenplay, and a powerful soundtrack, <strong>Thudarum</strong> is a film that promises to keep viewers at the edge of their seats.</p>

                    <h3>Plot & Storyline</h3>
                    <p><strong>Thudarum</strong> follows Shanmugham, affectionately known as "Benz," a humble taxi driver from the picturesque hill town of Ranni, Pathanamthitta. His prized possession, a vintage Mark-I Ambassador, is at the center of the story. Shanmugham’s life is turned upside down when his car is wrongfully seized by the police due to a false narcotics charge. The film then traces his relentless pursuit to reclaim his beloved car, navigating through bureaucratic red tape and personal struggles.</p>

                    <p>The story is not just about reclaiming a car; it’s about justice, family, and resilience. The emotional connection Shanmugham has with his car symbolizes much more—a representation of his life's struggles, his work, and his identity. As the plot unfolds, it turns into a tense exploration of human persistence and the fight for what’s right, all while presenting a layered narrative of moral dilemmas and personal sacrifice.</p>

                    <h3>Performances</h3>
                    <p>Mohanlal, in the role of Shanmugham, delivers a masterclass in acting. His portrayal of a man caught between a personal loss and an unyielding resolve is nuanced and emotional. His natural charisma brings depth to the character, reminding audiences of his classic performances from the past. His chemistry with Shobana, who plays his wife Lalitha, is palpable and heartwarming, especially considering their reunion after a 15-year gap. The emotional weight their characters carry, coupled with Shobana's stellar performance, adds layers to the film's core themes of family, love, and support.</p>

                    <p>Prakash Varma, as the antagonist CI George Mathan, gives a solid performance, adding tension to the narrative. His nuanced portrayal of a law enforcer caught up in his own moral battle contrasts effectively with Mohanlal’s character. The supporting cast, including Farhaan Faasil, Maniyanpilla Raju, and Binu Pappu, all play their roles to perfection, contributing to the film’s solid ensemble cast.</p>

                    <h3>Direction & Screenplay</h3>
                    <p>Tharun Moorthy’s direction is sharp, providing a gripping cinematic experience. The screenplay, co-written with K. R. Sunil, keeps the audience invested throughout the film, never losing momentum. While the film explores themes of justice and revenge, it does so with subtlety, focusing on emotional storytelling rather than just action. The decision to keep the film grounded in realism adds to its appeal, making it a compelling watch for a wide audience.</p>

                    <p>The screenplay’s depth is further reflected in the exploration of the bureaucratic systems and personal relationships that shape Shanmugham’s journey. The film balances intense dramatic moments with light, tender moments of family, creating a complete cinematic experience.</p>

                    <h3>Cinematography & Music</h3>
                    <p>The film’s cinematography captures the serene yet rugged landscapes of Ranni and the other locations, using the surroundings to enhance the narrative’s emotional depth. The use of light and shadow in certain sequences amplifies the tension, adding to the film’s gritty atmosphere.</p>

                    <p>Jakes Bejoy’s music is a standout feature. The soundtrack complements the film’s tone perfectly, with the score weaving in seamlessly to elevate the emotional scenes and heighten the suspense during tense moments. The background music works in harmony with the plot, intensifying the film's emotional beats and enhancing the narrative.</p>

                    <h3>Pacing & Editing</h3>
                    <p>At a runtime of around 2 hours and 30 minutes, <strong>Thudarum</strong> maintains a steady pace, never dragging or feeling too rushed. The editing, handled by Shafeeque V. B. after the unfortunate passing of editor Nishadh Yusuf, keeps the flow smooth, ensuring the film doesn’t lose momentum. The final act, with its emotional and action-packed sequences, is particularly well-edited, leaving a lasting impact on the viewer.</p>

                    <h3>User's Personal Opinion</h3>
                    <p>What really stands out to me about <strong>Thudarum</strong> is how it showcases the originality in storytelling, particularly in the way it defies our expectations. The film initially makes you believe that a father has killed his son, but as the plot unfolds, we realize that this isn't the truth. In fact, it highlights the father's desperate circumstances, where he is forced to make tragic decisions, influenced by the threats to his family's safety. This complex emotional depth is what makes the film so powerful.</p>

                    <p>Moreover, the movie also draws attention to the dark reality of crimes committed in the name of caste, religion, and status. These societal issues often overshadow basic humanity, and <strong>Thudarum</strong> effectively portrays how these systems of oppression lead people to take extreme measures. It’s a haunting reminder of how these inhumane acts can often be concealed behind superficial causes and how people, caught in such systems, often struggle with their moral compass.</p>

                    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                    <p><strong>Thudarum</strong> is not just another crime thriller; it’s a film that resonates with themes of personal struggle, justice, and the power of resilience. With Mohanlal delivering one of his finest performances in recent years, coupled with an emotionally charged screenplay and a superb supporting cast, this film is undoubtedly one of the standout Malayalam films of 2025. Tharun Moorthy has crafted a masterpiece that blends suspense, emotion, and social commentary, making it a must-watch for fans of the genre.</p>

                    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> 4.5/5</p>
                    <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> <em>Thudarum</em> is a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, leaving a lasting impression on both your heart and mind.</p>
