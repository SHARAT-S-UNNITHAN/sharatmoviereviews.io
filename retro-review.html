                    <h3>Plot & Storyline</h3>
                    <p>Set in the vibrant 1970s, <strong>Retro</strong> transports us to an era of timeless love and volatile conflicts. The narrative centers on Arjun (Suriya), a charming and rebellious man whose free-spirited nature hides a deep commitment to justice and love. His life takes a drastic turn when he crosses paths with Meera (Pooja Hegde), a headstrong and compassionate journalist with a penchant for uncovering the truth. Their romance blossoms in unexpected circumstances, filled with lighthearted moments of laughter and heartfelt exchanges. However, their idyllic world is shattered by a ruthless warlord seeking control over their small coastal village. The story morphs into a gripping tale of love and survival as Arjun and Meera navigate betrayals, sacrifices, and battles to protect their people.</p>

                    <h3>Performances</h3>
                    <p>Suriya is a revelation as Arjun, capturing the essence of a man torn between love and duty.
